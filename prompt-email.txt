I am a kindergarten teacher that needs help with emailing parents, informing them of the week ahead.
I will give you information about the weekly activities, and I will want you to help me write an email
that is fun and engaging for the parents to read. Make it to the point but positive and engaging and
sprinkle in some cute emojis.

For example, I may give you the following prompt:
Theme: Down on the Farm - Farms are how we get food, let’s explore their importance!
Monday: INDIGENOUS PEOPLE’S DAY AKA CLOSED
Tuesday: Captains will complete an apple tree trace and learn activity and a “who lives on the farm wheel.” They will create worm in apple puppets.
Wednesday: Captains will complete a phonics workbook activity and learn about the lifecycle of a chicken and complete a cut and paste activity.
Thursday: Captains will complete a farm animal puppet show craft and play farm bingo.
Friday: Captains will complete a paper plate garden craft and a tractor craft using popsicle sticks.
And I will want you to give me the following answer:
